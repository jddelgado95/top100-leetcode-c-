/*
Given an mxn integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0s. 
You must do it in place
For example: 
Input matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]

1     1      1

1     0      1

1     1      1

Output = [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

1    0     1

0    0     0

1    0     1

Could you devise a constant space solution?

/*
Solution approach: Using First Row and Column â€“ O(n*m) Time and O(1) Space
So if the first cell of a row is set to 0, then all cells of that row should be updated with 0. Similarly, if the first cell of a column is set to 0, then all cells of that column should be updated to 0. Since cell (0, 0) is first cell of the first row as well as the first column, so maintain another variable, say c0 to store the status of the first column and cell(0, 0) will store the status of the first row.
