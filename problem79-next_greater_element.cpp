https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/
Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.

The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]

Solution approach:

We will create a stack where we store the positions 

Key Idea:
We use a monotonic decreasing stack (top of the stack is the index of the largest unresolved value). When a greater value appears, we resolve all smaller values from the stack.

            //Pop values from my stack where value is less than the current value
            //If nums[i] (current element) is greater than nums[stack.top()], then nums[i] is the next greater element for the number at index stack.top(). So we update the answer array:
            while(stack.size() > 0 && nums[stack.top()] < current){
                //We're assigning the next greater element for the index at the top of the stack.
