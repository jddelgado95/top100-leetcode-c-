https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

Using Recursion â€“ O(2^n) Time and O(n) Space
We can easily identify the recursive nature of this problem. A person can reach nth stair either from (n-1)th stair or (n-2)th stair. Thus, for each stair n, we calculate the number of ways to reach the (n-1)th and (n-2)th stairs, and add them to get the total number of ways to reach the nth stair. This gives us the following recurrence relation:

countWays(n) = countWays(n-1) + countWays(n-2)

How many ways takes me to go from point i to point n?
